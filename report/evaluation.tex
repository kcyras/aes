\section{Measures of Success}

The success of the project can be measured by comparing the project results with objectives. We will also review the design choices in constructing the tool. The review will highlight the practical outcomes from using argumentation to explain scheduling.

One objective is to implement an accessible tool. To measure accessibility, we can refer to the tractability complexity from explanations. The length of explanations either in the number of words or characters may be correlated with understandability. Alternatively, we can conduct a survey targetted towards potential users. Because the understandability of explanations are difficult to measure, we will attempt to quantity this using multiple choice questions.

We can also use the survey to ask how well our tool performs with respect to applicability and knowledge transfer. We can also infer the practical limitations from the tool to measure the applicability.
