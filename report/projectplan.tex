\section{Milestones}

The primary objective of the project is to correctly implement the tool. The implementation is composed of multiple small milestones:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item\textbf{Solver integration:} The tool depends on an external optimisation library. External libraries are subject to licensing issues, poor interfacing and lack of clear documentation. Hence, using solvers are a significant risk.
	\item\textbf{Argumentation:} Implementation of the argumentation methodology requires through understanding of paper \cite{aes}. Background research is crucial for an efficient and extensible implementation. The paper explicitly states the definitions of required AFs, hence their construction should be trivial. However, their generated explanations from using the stability extension rely on human intuition and are not formally expressed. The paper states that for any schedule, there exists an explanation, implying that a formalism exists. This implementation would be challenging, but this is at the core of the project.
	\item\textbf{GUI:} For the tool to be accessible to computer novices, a GUI allows users to easily interact with explanations. There are many GUI tutorials for many different libraries. Choosing a GUI library will require some investigation. Creating a good user experience may be time-consuming, but this is a low risk.
\end{enumerate}

Secondary objectives would include finding opportunities to expand ArgOpt. At the time of writing, there are many future directions regarding scheduling. These include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Modelling waiting times between jobs. This can represent delays between appointments of patients and nurses, or in general, context-switch overhead for machines.
	\item Modelling dependencies between jobs. This can represent a process with a sequence of jobs.
\end{itemize}
